This Tool is written in Ruby to realize a Deque, a combination of Queue and Stack.

It contains two Classes Deque with all the logic and EmptyError which is raised when a remove is called
on an empty container.

Otherwise then Stack it is not removing and Elements on get. It has own remove Methods.

According to that you will find a test Class.
